# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** Ship an autonomous framework that any Claude Code Max plan user can install with one command and immediately start building software
**Current focus:** v1.3 Codex Integration — Phase 14 (Codex CLI Provider Substrate) and Phase 15 (Codex-Routed Gates + Qualitative MUDA Probe) staged in ROADMAP.md. Ready to discuss Phase 14.

## Current Position

Phase: 13 COMPLETE (7 plans executed, verifier PASS 16/16 invariants)
Plan: — (all 7/7 Phase 13 plans shipped)
Status: Ready for milestone close
Last activity: 2026-04-23 -- Phase 13 closed

Progress: [██████████] 100% (5/5 phases complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (from v1.1 — retained)

- D001: Opus orchestrates, Sonnet executes, Haiku classifies
- D002: Compressed XML plans (~800 tokens vs ~2,000 prose)
- D003: Structured 300-word agent reports
- D004: JSONL token logging
- D005: Frontmatter-only reads + brv-query-local
- D006: No API keys — Max plan OAuth only
- D007 (DLB-01): Git-native filesystem memory tier, no MCP, 40-file tripwire
- D008 (DLB-02): MUDA write-path only with kill condition
- D009 (DLB-03): Structural intent injection + cascade rule + coverage kill check
- D010 (DLB-04): Scoped Agents manifest + operator-gated SEPL + trajectory-hypothesis distillation
- D011 (retro): FLOOR gate operates per-brief; cascade does not trigger re-inheritance
- D012 (retro): AGP-P-02 resource-protocol scope is a floor, not a ceiling
- D013 (retro): Lightweight decision-note format `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` sits alongside `DLB-NN`

### Open Dependencies (v1.2 scoping-time)

- **Phase 9** (ATC-147-Evidence) — ✅ COMPLETE. Delivered classification.yaml, gate-bypass.yaml, INTENT.md, evidence/147-review.md, verify.mjs. 2 ATC warnings flagged for Phase 10 consumer (verifier row-arithmetic not enforced, bucket detail-vs-map cross-check missing) — no blockers.
- **Phase 10** (Gate Policy) — intra-milestone block on Phase 9 CLEARED. Empirical finding count, bucket classification, and token bounds (18,940 upper / 9,340 lower) now available. Ready to discuss.
- **Phase 12** (Machinery) — intra-milestone block on Phase 11 (schema v2) CLEARED, still blocked on Phase 10 (gate matrix).
- **Phase 13** (Governance) — intra-milestone block on Phase 10 (gates.yaml precedent) remains; Phase 11 (schema-ownership precedent) CLEARED.
- **Phase 11** (Plan Schema v2) — ✅ COMPLETE (shipped 2026-04-21).

### Pending Todos

- /gsd-discuss-phase 10 — next phase; consumes Phase 9's 09-classification.yaml, 09-gate-bypass.yaml, and the 2 ATC warnings as Phase 10 keep/kill inputs.
- Phase 10 should address the 2 verifier coverage gaps noted in 09-ATC-REVIEW.md when it designs the keep/kill rubric.
- At v1.2 close, run GOV-05 post-deliberation scoring audit (milestone-close hook) and re-evaluate retro RQ1 per reopen clause.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None. All Phase 9 external blockers resolved; v1.2 progress at 40% (2/5 phases).
